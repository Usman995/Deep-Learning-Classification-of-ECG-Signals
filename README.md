**Arrhythmia** is a heart rhythm disorder that affects the rate and pattern of the heartbeat. Among the various types of arrhythmia, **Atrial Fibrillation (AF)** is the most common. AF is characterized by a chaotic and frequently fast heartbeat. Additionally, AF increases the risk of cardioembolic stroke and other heart-related conditions, such as heart failure. Given these serious health risks, it is crucial to screen for AF and provide appropriate treatment before the condition worsens.

## Project Objective

The primary goal of this project is to develop a **classifier model** capable of distinguishing and classifying different types of arrhythmias based on a provided dataset. The project follows the **CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining)** framework to ensure a structured approach to the experiment. This report covers the relevant research in this field and outlines how the CRISP-DM methodology is applied to achieve the project objectives.
